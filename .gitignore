# Docker specific ignores
# These are files that might be generated by Docker or during Docker builds
# but should NOT be committed to your Git repository.
# Note: This .gitignore is for the *host* repository.
# For files *inside* the Docker build context that you want to exclude from the image,
# you'd use a separate .dockerignore file.
docker-compose.override.yml # Often used for local development overrides, not production
docker-compose.local.yml    # Another common pattern for local overrides

.dockerignore               # While this file is usually committed, if you have a reason not to, you can ignore it here.

# Logs generated by various tools (beyond Laravel's storage/logs)
